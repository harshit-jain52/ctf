# [Corrupted File](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/138)

1. As the problem states, the solution lies in the header of the given file:

    ```bash
    head unopenable.gif | xxd
    ```

2. Some [googling](https://www.file-recovery.com/gif-signature-format.htm) told that GIF files start with `GIF87a` or `GIF89a`, but the given file's header begins with `9a`. Edit the header accordingly, Voila!, now the GIF is _openable_.
3. Use some [online tool](https://ezgif.com/split) to get the frames of the GIF, which give us the encoded flag.
4. Decode the flag:

    ```bash
    echo "<encoded-flag>" | base64 -d
    ```
