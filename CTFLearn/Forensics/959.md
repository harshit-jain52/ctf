1. There are two kinds of whitespace in the text file (`sed 's/\(.\)/\1\n/g' TheMessage.txt | sort | uniq -c`), transform one into 0 and other into 1:

    ```python
    with open("TheMessage.txt", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.read()
        space1, space2 = set(content)
        print(content.replace(space1, '0').replace(space2, '1'))
    ```

2. Transform the binary into ASCII:

    ```bash
    echo "obase=16; ibase=2; <binary-string> | bc | xxd -r -p"
    ```
