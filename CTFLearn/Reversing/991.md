1. Start gdb, `break` at main, `run` with some random flag, and `disas` main
2. First of all, function *_Z4Msg1Pc* is called, after which there's a *puts*. Disassembling and observing (too complex) doesn't help much. Break after function:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) b *main+43
    Breakpoint 2 at 0x55555555512b
    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

    Breakpoint 2, 0x000055555555512b in main ()
    (gdb) x/s $rbp
    0x5555555581c0 <buffer>:    "Welcome to CTFlearn Riyadh Reversing Challenge!"
    ```

3. Function *_Z18CTFLearnHiddenFlagv* doesnt't do anything:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) disas _Z18CTFLearnHiddenFlagv
    Dump of assembler code for function _Z18CTFLearnHiddenFlagv:
    0x0000555555555d20 <+0>:    endbr64
    0x0000555555555d24 <+4>:    ret
    End of assembler dump.
    ```

4. Doing point-2 above with *_Z4Msg3Pc*:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) b *main+90
    Breakpoint 5 at 0x55555555515a
    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

    Breakpoint 5, 0x000055555555515a in main ()
    (gdb) x/s $rbp
    0x5555555581c0 <buffer>:    "CTFlearn{Reversing_Is_Easy}"
    ```

    Trying this tells this isn't the actual flag :cry: \
    The *strcmp* after this *_Z4Msg3Pc* probably takes the program to instructions which print "You found the false flag!  It's not that easy dude!". So running with some other flag would bypass this jump.

5. To reach *_Z4Msg5Pc*, we have to pass strlen test:

    ```gdb
    (gdb) b *main+117
    Breakpoint 9 at 0x555555555175
    (gdb) b*main+151
    Breakpoint 10 at 0x555555555197
    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

    Breakpoint 9, 0x0000555555555175 in main ()
    (gdb) set $rax=0x1e
    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

    Breakpoint 10, 0x0000555555555197 in main ()
    (gdb) x/s $rbp
    0x55555556b6c0: "CTFlearn{Masmak_Fortress_1865}"
    ```
