# DialUp

> It's a familiar sound to anyone who's ever dialed a phone. What's this caller trying to say?

- We are given a wav file, which sounds like dialing a phone
- Use a [DTMF Decoder](https://dtmf.netlify.app/) to get the number being dialled
- Convert the decimal to hex
- Convert the hex to text, and we get the flag
