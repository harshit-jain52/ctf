# Your First Overflow

## Your First Overflow (easy)

Value of `win` variable needs to be overwritten using buffer overflow. As written in the debug output, `win` is stored 68 bytes after the input. \
Give atleast 69 bytes of input

## Your First Overflow (hard)

Value of `win` variable needs to be overwritten using buffer overflow. \
Source code:

```c
struct
{
    char input[98];
    int win_variable;
} data  = {0} ;
```

Trying input of 99, 100, 101 bytes... 100 works!
