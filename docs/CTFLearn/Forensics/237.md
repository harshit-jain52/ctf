1. Given is a **network capture file** whose contents can be read using `tshark`. From Hint 1,

   ```bash
   tshark -r data.pcap -Y "http.request.method == POST" -Tfields -e text
   ```

2. We get login credentials which contain an encoded password:

   ```bash
   echo "<pswrd>" | base64 -d
   ```
