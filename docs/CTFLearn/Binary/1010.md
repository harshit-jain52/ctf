# [Simple bof](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/1010)

Run `nc thekidofarcrania.com 35235` to observe the interface and IO \
Run `cat bof.c` to observe the source code

Observations:

1. There is a `secret` variable whose value is `0xdeadbeef` which matches (reverse ('cause STACK) of) the red part of the visualization. This indicates the buffer has to be overflowed precisely to reach and modify the red part.
2. In the source code, `secret` is compared with `0x67616c66`, which is `galf` in ASCII, so we have to end the buffer overflow with `flag`.
3. On prompt at interface, enter any ASCII character 48 times, followed by "flag", e.g., `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaflag`
