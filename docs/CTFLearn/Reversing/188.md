1. Try `strings` command, doesn't help much.
2. Start gdb, `break` at main, `run` with some random flag, and `disas` main
3. Notice various comments with addresses, printing some of them using `x/s` gives some of the strings that `strings` gave, while some of them are blank which may fill up during execution
4. Break at the end and print the strings again

   ```gdb
   (gdb) break *main+286
   Breakpoint 2 at 0x55555540085e
   (gdb) c
   Continuing.
   Input password: sdfghjkl
   Wrong password

   Breakpoint 2, 0x000055555540085e in main ()
   (gdb) x/s 0x555555601140
   0x555555601140 <msg>:   "AbCTF{r3vers1ng_dud3}"
   ```
