# Cracking The Javashop

```text
My favorite coffee shop is opening a new website, but they locked it behind a combination lock page! Can you hack the page to get access early?
```

The correct combination is hardcoded in the client-side code:

```html
<script>
    const wheels = document.querySelectorAll('.wheel');
    const correctCombination = ['6', '8', '7', '2'];
    const messageElement = document.getElementById('message');
    const accessDeniedSound = new Audio('access_denied.mp3');
    const accessGrantedSound = new Audio('access_granted.mp3');
.
.
.
.
</script>
```
