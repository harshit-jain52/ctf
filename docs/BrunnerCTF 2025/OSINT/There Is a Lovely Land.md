# There Is a Lovely Land

```text
The Danish national anthem is called "Der er et yndigt land" ("There Is a Lovely Land"), and I fully agree.

A friend of mine took this picture, but I don't know the name of the bridge! Please help me find it so I can go see it!

Flag format: brunner{<bridge name in Danish in lowercase>}
