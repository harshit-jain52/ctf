# JaWT Scratchpad

The homepage asks us to register with a name.

Using "admin" results in:

```text
YOU CANNOT LOGIN AS THE ADMIN! HE IS SPECIAL AND YOU ARE NOT.
```

Using any other name logs us in, and stores a JWT cookie, decoding which gives:

```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}
```

```json
{
  "user": "john"
}
```

The text on the page links to [JohnTheRipper](https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper)

```text
Register with your name!
You can use your name as a log in, because that's quick and easy to remember! If you don't like your name, use a short and cool one like John!
```

Using the said tool:

```shell
run $ echo "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiam9obiJ9._fAF3H23ckP4QtF1Po3epuZWxmbwpI8Q26hRPDTh32Y" > jwt.txt
run $ ./john jwt.txt --format=HMAC-SHA256 --wordlist=/home/harshit/Downloads/rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8

```

So, the SECRET is `ilovepico`

Using this secret and payload {"user": "admin"}, create JWT token. Edit the value of the cookie, reloading now displays the flag!
