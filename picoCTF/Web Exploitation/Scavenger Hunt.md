# Scavenger Hunt

The flag is broken into 5 parts:

1. Skim through `index.html`, 1st piece is in a comment. We also get to know about the CSS and JS files used
2. 2nd piece is in `mycss.css`
3. A hint is given in `myjs.js`:

    ```js
    /* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
    ```

    This clearly refers to the [robots.txt](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt) file. There lies the 3rd piece with another hint.
4. Hint:

    ```text
    # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
    ```

    After some researching, got to know about [.htacess](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13170819/what-is-htaccess-file) file. There's the 4th piece with another hint.
5. Hint:

    ```text
    # I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
    ```

    This clearly indicates looking for [.DS_Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store). Voila! 5th piece acquired.
