# Flags

- We are given an image with a series of Flag icons
- As we know the flag format if PICOCTF{}, we can get a part of the answer: P I C O C T F {F _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ T _ F F}
- This seems more like an OSINT challenge. I searched for "red,white,blue stripes flag" (the icon for **T**) which led me to [this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flags_with_blue,_red,_and_white_stripes), where I found *Tango*, and *International maritime signal*
- [The wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags) for International Maritime Signal Flags contain all the icons given in the image and their corresponding alphabets/digits. Use this to decipher the flag.
