print_lines(p)
```

## level 2.1

```text
In this level you need to craft assembly code to satisfy the following 
conditions:
* exchange the value of rax and rbx
```

```python
payload = asm("xchg rax, rbx")
```

## level 2.2

```text
In this level you need to craft assembly code to complete the following 
operations:
* rax = rax % rbx + rcx - rsi

We already set the following in preparation for your code:
rdx = 0
```

```python
payload = asm("div rbx") # computes (rdx:rax) / rbx â†’ quotient in rax, remainder in rdx
payload += asm("mov rax, rdx") # rax = rax % rbx
payload += asm("add rax, rcx") # rax = rax % rbx + rcx
payload += asm("sub rax, rsi") # rax = rax % rbx + rcx - rsi
```

## level 2.3

```text
In this level you need to craft assembly code to complete the following 
operations:
* copy 8-bytes memory starting at 0x404000 to 8-bytes memory starting at 
0x405000
```

```python
payload = asm("""
    mov rax, [0x404000]
    mov [0x405000], rax
""")
```

## level 2.4

```text
In this level you need to craft assembly code to complete the following 
operations:
* the top value of the stack = the top value of the stack - rbx

Tips: perfer push and pop instructions, other than directly  dereference
```

```python
payload = asm("""
    pop rax
    sub rax, rbx
    push rax
""")
```

## level 2.5

```text
In this level you need to craft assembly code to complete the following 
operations:
* the top value of the stack = abs(the top value of the stack)
```

```python
payload = asm("""
    pop rax
    test rax, rax
    jns done
    neg rax
done:
    push rax
""")
```

## level 2.6

```text
In this level you need to craft for statement to complete the following 
operations:
* rax = the sum from 1 to rcx
```

```python
payload = asm("""
    xor rax, rax
    mov rbx, 1
loop_start:
    cmp rbx, rcx
    jg loop_end
    add rax, rbx
    inc rbx
    jmp loop_start
loop_end:
""")
```
