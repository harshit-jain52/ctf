# Precision (hard)

1. In gdb, `disas challenge`, we get to know:
    - win is at **rbp-0x14** = rbp-20
    - lose is at **rbp-0x10** = rbp-16

2. Set a breakpoint `b *challenge+154`, run and give a long string of a's as input
3. `info frame` -> rbp is at **0x7ffcf5793e40**
4. `x/100xg $rbp-200` -> input buffer starts at **0x7ffcf5793e00**, which is **rbp-0x40** = rbp-64
5. Giving 44-48 a's as input works
