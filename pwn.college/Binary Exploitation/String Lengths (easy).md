# String Lengths (easy)

1. GDB -> `disas win_authed` -> the address of instruction after auth check is **0x211f**
2. As told in the debug output, the return address from challenge() is stored at 72 bytes from start of input buffer
3. Observing from source code, length computed by strlen() on input must be < 28

    ```shell
    echo -n -e "aaa\x00aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\x1f\x21" | /challenge/binary-exploitation-null-write-w
    ```

> we need to write two bytes, then one of those nibbles (the fourth least-significant one) will be a guess, and it will be incorrect 15 of 16 times. This is okay: we can just run our exploit a few times until it works (statistically, ~50% chance after 11 times and ~90% chance after 36 times)
